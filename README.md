# Innovation-Project

## Philosophy 

My desire to get into the concrete and energize my studies led me to DVIC. Being part of the DVIC allows me both to satisfy my curiosity and to directly apply the knowledge I've been lucky enough to acquire. Project-based learning encourages creativity and autonomy. 

### The modular green wall 

A review of existing green wall solutions has revealed the diverse benefits they offer. However, indoor green walls pose unique challenges, requiring special attention to maintenance, lighting and water. The aim of this project is to meet these challenges with a carefully designed structure of interconnected rectangular modules and a modular design allowing flexibility in location, rotation and custom design.

### Vision : Reconnect people with nature

We believe in a profound reconnection with nature, which we consider essential to our well-being. That's why we aim to establish a plant-based system designed for urban environments, accessible to all. With 45% of the French population living in apartments without gardens, we are focused on creating a versatile indoor plant system[[4]](https://dvic.devinci.fr/projects/modular-green-wall#fn4). Aware of the difficulties involved in maintaining plants, particularly in terms of time, we want to minimize the need for maintenance. Our vision is to reconnect people with nature and demonstrate its anti-stress and productive benefits through a modular, low-maintenance houseplant system. The system is designed to be almost 100% self-sufficient, considerably reducing the time needed to maintain the plants. Its modularity allows users to express their creativity by modifying the system effortlessly. By introducing plants indoors, the idea is to create a daily visual link with nature, thereby improving the quality of life for city dwellers.

### The structure

The green wall is made up of a structure with two rails on each side and interconnected rectangular modules. These modules fit into the rails, providing support for the green wall. Plants are placed in two pots on each module, ensuring perfect stability and balance due to the thoughtful placement of the pots relative to the structure's center.

For flexibility, the modules come in various shapes, allowing easy changes in placement and rotation (in x and y directions). This flexibility promotes creativity, unique designs, and a personal touch to the green wall structure. Maintenance is simplified with a self-braking winch. Modules can be easily detached and removed from the rail. The same principle is applied when putting modules back in place, allowing for easy modification of the green wall's design and maintenance.

### The lighting system

Finally, lamps system are added to ensure the survival of the plants. The goal is to create modulable lamps that are perfectly adapted to the plant on the wall. I didDIY lamps that we can place wherever we want on the wall, with a arm that can twist and with the right intensity of the leds thanks to calculations about the lumens needed to illuminate each type of plant.

### List of Material

A number of essential materials are required to complete the project:
To ensure a robust electrical connection -> minimum 10-meter-long electrical wire with a 1.5 mmÂ² cross-section
For efficient energy management/power supply -> plugs and a 4-socket power strip
For lighting -> G4 bulbs and 12V G4 sockets
To automate the lighting cycle -> square mechanical programmer
For easy manual control -> black switch 6A at 250V
To ensure a neat layout -> cable ties in sufficient quantity (approx. 60)
To protect connections and ensure proper insulation -> heat-shrink tubing
To power LEDs safely -> transformer compatible
